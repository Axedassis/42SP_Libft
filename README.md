# Libft 42SP🌵

### 🗣️What is libft?
Libft is a solo project at 42 that challenges students to implement a collection of essential C library functions from scratch, along with additional utility functions. This project serves as a foundational exercise, reinforcing key programming concepts and providing a custom-built library of functions that will be valuable for future projects and further C programming endeavors. By completing Libft, students gain deeper insight into how these core functions operate and acquire the skills needed to create efficient, reusable code for a wide range of applications.
