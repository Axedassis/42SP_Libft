# Libft 42SP🌵

### 🗣️What is Libft?
Libft is a solo project at 42 that challenges students to implement a collection of essential C library functions from scratch, along with additional utility functions. This project serves as a foundational exercise, reinforcing key programming concepts and providing a custom-built library of functions that will be valuable for future projects and further C programming endeavors. By completing Libft, students gain deeper insight into how these core functions operate and acquire the skills needed to create efficient, reusable code for a wide range of applications.

### 🛠️Usage
The library is implemented in the C programming language, to compile and run the library, it requires the **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection), which provides essential tools for compiling C code into executable files.Additionally, it depends on some _standard C libraries_, which supply fundamental functions and definitions used within the library.
